You are an expert researcher who specializes in LLM. We are studying how to improve the training efficiency of a ~124M scale LLM. Our goal is to improve the Pareto frontier of validation loss and training time. You will be given a fixed corpus and stepsize to train the model on.
"""


BACKGROUND = """
### Background on Large Language Models (LLMs)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand, summarize, translate, predict, and generate coherent, human-like text. At their core, most LLMs are trained on a fundamental objective: **next-word prediction**. Given a sequence of words, the model learns to predict the most probable next word. This simple objective, when trained on a massive and diverse corpus of text from the internet, enables the model to learn grammar, facts, reasoning abilities, and different styles of writing.

***

### Benefits and Properties

* **Unsupervised Learning**: LLMs can be trained on vast amounts of raw text without needing explicit human-made labels, making it possible to leverage internet-scale datasets.
* **Contextual Understanding**: Based on the Transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism is exceptionally effective at capturing long-range dependencies, allowing the model to maintain context over long passages of text.
* **Scalability**: The Transformer architecture scales remarkably well. Increasing the model size (more layers, larger embeddings), training data, and compute consistently leads to better performance and the emergence of new capabilities not explicitly trained for (e.g., translation, summarization).

***

### LLM Evaluation

How well can a Large Language Model learn a language? It can be evaluated based on its performance during training and its efficiency, using standard industry metrics.

* **Validation Loss**: This is the model's Cross-Entropy Loss calculated on a held-out "validation" dataset that it does not see during training. This metric is the primary indicator of how well the model is **generalizing** to new text, rather than just memorizing the training data. A lower validation loss is better.
* **Training Time**: The total wall-clock time required to train the model to reach our target loss. If you don't reach the target loss, then training time is MEANINGLESS. It would be considered a FAILURE.

Note your PRIMARY goal is to reach a validation loss target with as little time as possible. If you don't reach the target loss, then any time improvement is MEANINGLESS. A 0.01 validation loss increase is considered significant!
"""

KNOWLEDGE_BASE = """
# Knowledge base
- Muon optimizer improved validation loss.
- Architectural changes including untied embeddings and output heads, padded embeddings, ReLU² activations, zero-initialized projections, and QK-normalization improved performance. ReLU^2 is known to perform better than GELU and SwiGLU.
- Various skip connections, including U-net patterns for values and embeddings improved performance.
- Merged the QKV (Query, Key, Value) weights and implemented a long-short attention pattern to improve performance.
- Applying RoPE to half truncated head dimension is known to perform better than applying it to full head dimension.
- There may be a way to distribute the load of finding bos token indicies for all 8 files. If each GPU is given 1 file instead of 8 to locate the bos_tokens, this could save up to roughly 200ms*7 = 1.4 seconds assuming zero overhead.
- The total number of [4,768,768] attention variables to 10. There are 22 MLP variables of size [768x4,768]. In Muon attention is getting batched such that 6/16ths on the gradient calcs are on padding tokens. There may be a way to move 2 of the attention variables into the MLP batch, such that MLP is 24/24 and attn is 8/8, instead of MLP being 22/24 and attn being 10/16.
- Each optimization is there for a reason, reverting them to a more conventional set up will very likely degrade the performance, so DO NOT try an idea just because it is a "common" approach. Instead, BE CREATIVE!

### Current state-of-the-art
The current state-of-the-art algorithm is as follows:
```python
{sota_algorithm}
```

{KNOWLEDGE_BASE}
{ablation_descriptions}

## Your Task

You will make reasonable changes to improve the performance of language model training (We provide you with performance metrics targets, note that they are not necessarily the performance of the current SoTA algorithms). The experiment strategy is to improve the current state-of-the-art algorithm by evaluating dozens or hundreds of candidates with small perturbations. Try to strike a balance between safe, easy changes that are very likely to improve performance ("exploit-heavy" candidates) and more exploratory changes that help us understand the space of possible algorithms ("explore-heavy" candidates).

Anything except increasing model size is fair game. You understand certain changes cause change in model size (such as different attention mechanism), but keep model size under 150M. You may think about how to improve the optimizer, introducing/replacing different layer types or other architectural changes (just don't increase model size too much), different positional embeddings. Reason about how those changes affect both validation loss and training time.

You must consider the results of past experiments when designing your candidate. For example, if the notes show poor performance from a strategy, does it make sense to try the opposite? Is there a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned properly? Is there any additional information that you can compute or obtain? These are just suggestions - feel free to come up with additional directions to explore.

Your task is to analyze the current state-of-the-art algorithm, construct an algorithm candidate by editing the current state-of-the-art method, and write the final Python output code for the candidate.

{CODING_REQ}

Please follow these steps:

1. Explanation of the current state-of-the-art.
2. Brainstorm several possible ideas. Try to be creative while also considering the results of past experiments. Provide a reasoning for each idea.
3. Think through which idea is the most promising one to implement. Explain your reasoning, select the best idea (or combination of ideas), and describe your proposed modification.
4. Code implementation of the candidate.

Idea repos contain ideas that we have generated so far, and experiments we have run to test these hypotheses.

{idea_repo}

## Your Task

When proposing a new design or hyperparameter configuration, you should start by conducting a research brainstorming exercise where you develop 3 different options to explore the design space. Go through each option, providing a comprehensive explanation for the proposed changes including
* The underlying rationale and expected impact.
* The specific reason why you expect this experiment to be worth running.

# Final Instructions

You should try to understand why a particular design performed well / poorly, so that you can make a more informed choice for the next set of designs. It is important to strike a good balance between exploration of the design space and tuning to find the best hyperparameter values. One way to tune is to develop some hypotheses about how the design might affect performance, and then conduct experiments that would test those hypotheses.

You are encouraged to consider configurations that we might not have thought of before, and it is likely that you will discover some patterns during your search process. You are STRONGLY encouraged to look through your experiment history and refer back to the designs that we have already tested, to make sure that the design you are proposing makes sense in that broader research context (i.e., are not too similar, and are informed by past results). If an idea has seen rich experiment history but the performance has plateaued, then perhaps it's time to switch to a new idea.

Feel free to think outside of the box - you are allowed to propose candidates that are high risk (or even expected to be quality-negative) if it helps you understand the problem better, furthers your long-term research agenda, and (most importantly) increases your chance to produce a final candidate. The goal is to produce a final candidate after roughly 500 attempts, not to find a locally-optimal solution right away. That said, please do be mindful of your compute usage - do not redo configurations that you have already tried (the results will almost certainly be the same), and please do your best to deliver a good candidate by the end of your 500 attempts. We will take the best candidate discovered in your entire tuning process as your final candidate - it does not matter WHEN you find a good candidate, as long as you eventually do so.

Go through the idea and experiment history carefully, DO NOT re-propose an idea that has been well tested already. 

You should follow the following format when generating ideas:
** Idea 1 **
Hypothesis: <Your idea here>
Reasoning: <Your reasoning here>

** Idea 2 **
Hypothesis: <Your idea here>
Reasoning: <Your reasoning here>

...

** Idea N **
