### Codebase documentation
Your code will be run to evaluate the correctness and runtime of your kernel. You must ensure the correctness of your kernel while optimizing the runtime.

#### Writing code

{CODING_REQ}
"""

TASK_INTRO = """
You are an expert researcher who specializes in high performance machine learning kernels. We are studying optimizing the kernel of a given machine learning operator (could be an operation, a neural network layer, or a model).
"""

# The following prompt is modified from GEPA: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19457
BACKGROUND = """
To optimize a given PyTorch model by replacing operators with custom CUDA kernels, follow these detailed instructions. Your goal is to achieve performance improvements while ensuring correctness. Name your optimized output architecture ‘ModelNew‘. Output the new model code in codeblocks. Please generate real code, NOT pseudocode, and ensure the code compiles and is fully functional. Do not include testing code.

### Steps to Create Custom CUDA Kernels

#### 1. Identify Operators to Replace

* Analyze the model to identify operators that can benefit from custom CUDA implementations.

* Consider operator fusion opportunities to combine multiple operations into a single kernel for efficiency.

#### 2. Setup and Compilation

* Use ‘torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline‘ to compile your CUDA code. This allows you to define and compile custom CUDA kernels directly within your Python script.

* Ensure all necessary CUDA and C++ headers are included to avoid missing includes errors.

#### 3. Implementing the CUDA Kernel

* Write the CUDA kernel code, ensuring it is optimized for parallel execution. Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and ensure coalesced memory access patterns.

* Example structure for a CUDA kernel:

```cpp
__global__ void my_kernel(const float* input, float* output, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < size) {
        // Perform computation
    }
}

```

#### 4. Kernel Launch Configuration

* Configure the kernel launch parameters (number of blocks and threads per block) to maximize GPU utilization.

* Example:

```
const int block_size = 256;
const int num_blocks = (size + block_size - 1) / block_size;
my_kernel<<<num_blocks, block_size>>>(input, output, size);

```

#### 5. Error Handling and Debugging

* Implement error checking after CUDA API calls and kernel launches using `cudaGetLastError()` to catch errors early.

* Use CUDA debugging tools like ‘cuda-memcheck‘ and NVIDIA Nsight for debugging and profiling.

* Be aware of common syntax errors and namespace issues, and ensure that the CUDA code adheres to syntax rules.

#### 6. Integrating with PyTorch

* Define a Python function that wraps the CUDA kernel call and integrates it into the PyTorch model.

* Example:

```python
def my_custom_op(input):
    output = torch.zeros_like(input)
    my_kernel(input.data_ptr<float>(), output.data_ptr<float>(), input.numel())
    return output

```

#### 7. Compatibility and Compute Capability

* Ensure that the CUDA code is compatible with the target GPU’s compute capability (A100-SXM4-40GB).

### Additional Best Practices

* **Optimize Memory Usage**: Minimize data transfers between host and device, and use shared memory to reduce global memory access.

* **Atomic Operations**: When using atomic operations like ‘atomicMax‘ with floating-point numbers, ensure correct usage by following best practices, such as using appropriate data types and minimizing contention.

* **Performance Optimization**: Maximize parallel execution, optimize memory access patterns, and use compiler flags to enhance performance.

* **Namespace Usage**: Avoid adding class declarations or function definitions directly to reserved namespaces like ‘cuda‘. Use nested namespaces within non-reserved namespaces to organize code.

* **Numerical Precision**: Be aware of floating-point arithmetic issues, such as non-associativity, and use appropriate precision levels for calculations.

By following these instructions, you can effectively replace PyTorch operators with custom CUDA kernels, ensuring both performance improvements and correctness.

### Instruction for Replacing PyTorch Operators with Custom CUDA Kernels

Your task is to optimize a given PyTorch model by replacing certain operators with custom CUDA kernels to achieve performance improvements. Follow the steps below to ensure a successful implementation:

#### Step 1: Identify Operators for Replacement

* **Criteria for Selection**: Choose operators that are computationally intensive and have potential for parallelization. Consider operators that are frequently used in the model’s forward pass.

* **Operator Fusion**: Look for opportunities to fuse multiple operators into a single CUDA kernel, such as combining matrix multiplication with activation functions (e.g., matmul + ReLU).

#### Step 2: Implement Custom CUDA Kernels

* **Kernel Structure**: Define your CUDA kernel using the ‘**global**‘ specifier. Ensure that each thread handles a specific part of the computation. Use correct index calculations to access data.

* **Memory Management**:

  * Allocate memory for input, output, and any intermediate data on the GPU using `cudaMalloc`. Use `cudaMemcpy` to transfer data between host and device.

  * Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.

  * Ensure coalesced global memory accesses for efficient memory transactions.

* **Numerical Stability and Boundary Conditions**:

  * Implement verification mechanisms to ensure numerical stability. Use ‘**host** **device**‘ functions for testing on both CPU and GPU.

  * Handle boundary conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. Ensure that thread indices are within valid ranges.

* **Optimization Techniques**:

  * Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.

  * Consider using mixed precision and Tensor Cores for matrix operations to enhance performance.

  * Avoid diverged execution paths to maintain efficient parallel execution.

#### Step 3: Integrate CUDA Kernels into PyTorch Model

* **Inline Compilation**: Use ‘torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline‘ to compile your CUDA code and integrate it into the PyTorch model.

* **Model Modification**: Replace the original PyTorch operators with calls to your custom CUDA functions. Ensure that the new model architecture (‘ModelNew‘) is fully functional and compiles without errors.

### Evaluation
You will be graded on kernel correctness and the runtime of the kernel. The lower the runtime, the better the kernel.

## Your Task

When proposing a new design or hyperparameter configuration, you should start by conducting a research brainstorming exercise where you develop 5 different options to explore the design space. Go through each option, providing a comprehensive explanation for the proposed changes including
* The underlying rationale and expected impact.
* The specific reason why you expect this experiment to be worth running.

Once you have brainstormed enough, pick an option that you think will stand the best shot of helping you to accomplish your overall goal (to discover a good candidate at some point during your search). Please try to strike a good balance between exploring dramatically new directions and proposing "safer" incremental changes - both types of exploration are equally important to make good progress. Once you have selected your final idea - the one that we will actually implement and apply to the model - write down your final idea and provide a concise explanation. Please avoid re-training models / designs that you have already tested - the results will almost certainly be the same and this will waste computational resources.

Note that we will ask you to summarize the idea and results after we run the experiment, but you will not have access to your brainstorming notes at that time. For this reason, your code should contain a complete description of your final idea, motivation, hypotheses, etc. It is okay to have a large file-level comment with this information, since this is research code.

Once your brainstorming and idea generation process is finished, you are ready to write code.

{CODING_REQ}

# Final Instructions


You should try to understand why a particular design performed well / poorly, so that you can make a more informed choice for the next set of designs. It is important to strike a good balance between exploration of the design space and tuning to find the best hyperparameter values. One way to tune is to develop some hypotheses about how the design might affect performance, and then conduct experiments that would test those hypotheses.

You are encouraged to consider configurations that we might not have thought of before, and it is likely that you will discover some patterns during your search process. You are STRONGLY encouraged to look through your experiment history and refer back to the designs that we have already tested, to make sure that the design you are proposing makes sense in that broader research context (i.e., are not too similar, and are informed by past results).

Feel free to think outside of the box - you are allowed to propose candidates that are high risk (or even expected to be quality-negative) if it helps you understand the problem better, furthers your long-term research agenda, and (most importantly) increases your chance to produce a final candidate. The goal is to produce a final candidate after roughly 500 attempts, not to find a locally-optimal solution right away. That said, please do be mindful of your compute usage - do not redo configurations that you have already tried (the results will almost certainly be the same), and please do your best to deliver a good candidate by the end of your 500 attempts. We will take the best candidate discovered in your entire tuning process as your final candidate - it does not matter WHEN you find a good candidate, as long as you eventually do so.

Note that you CANNOT tune servers, duplicates, objects, and epsilon, those are set during the eval phase.

If yes, explain your reasoning and respond with ONE candidate that you would like to try. Do not write any code yet - we will write the implementation in the next step. If you do not want to tune any hyperparameters, simply respond "No."
"""

HPARAM_IMPLEMENT_PROMPT = f"""
### Hyperparameter implementation
Please write the implementation of your hyperparameter candidate. Respond with a markdown-formatted code block that implements your improved algorithm.

{CODING_REQ}
"""

UPDATE_BASELINE_PROMPT = f"""
Should we update the baseline algorithm? Please answer yes or no then explain your reasoning. If the answer is yes, respond with a code block containing the candidate that we should use as the new baseline algorithm - this will most likely be the candidate that performed the best overall in hyperparameter ablations. If no, simply respond "No."
