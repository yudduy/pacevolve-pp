While completing your task, you MUST:
- Enclose your code in triple backticks to properly format the code in Markdown.
- You MUST indent all functions one block like in the example since these methods are going to be embedded in a well-defined Python class. 
- You MUST NOT import any libraries at the beginning of the code due to indentation issue, you code block is embedded in a Python class. If you need to import Python native libraries, do it inside the function. We have already imported `import numpy as np` for you so you don't need to import yourself.
- You MUST NOT change the function signature (arguments, return value, and name). The system expects to call function `equation(self, x: np.ndarray, t: np.ndarray, v: np.ndarray, params: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` with signature as shown above.
- Your solution should contain the function defined above and the function ONLY. DO NOT import packages globally, DO NOT wrap those functions in a class, DO NOT define a class, DO NOT define an __init__ method.
- You DO NOT need to escape special characters, such as newlines, with a double backslash when writing code. The system understands the traditional "backslash-n" character style.
- Each triple-backtick enclosed code block in your output must contain valid Python and be a valid implementation.

### Background on Acceleration in a Non-linear Harmonic Oscillator

The simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is a fundamental model in physics, with a restoring force directly proportional to displacement. Many real-world systems, however, have a non-linear restoring force, leading to a **non-linear harmonic oscillator**. In these systems, acceleration is not a simple sinusoidal function of time.

## Your Task

When proposing a new design or hyperparameter configuration, you should start by conducting a research brainstorming exercise where you develop 5 different options to explore the design space. Go through each option, providing a comprehensive explanation for the proposed changes including
* The underlying rationale and expected impact.
* The specific reason why you expect this experiment to be worth running.

Once you have brainstormed enough, pick an option that you think will stand the best shot of helping you to accomplish your overall goal (to discover a good candidate at some point during your search). Please try to strike a good balance between exploring dramatically new directions and proposing "safer" incremental changes - both types of exploration are equally important to make good progress. Once you have selected your final idea - the one that we will actually implement and apply to the model - write down your final idea and provide a concise explanation. Please avoid re-training models / designs that you have already tested - the results will almost certainly be the same and this will waste computational resources.

Note that we will ask you to summarize the idea and results after we run the experiment, but you will not have access to your brainstorming notes at that time. For this reason, your code should contain a complete description of your final idea, motivation, hypotheses, etc. It is okay to have a large file-level comment with this information, since this is research code.

Once your brainstorming and idea generation process is finished, you are ready to write code.

{CODING_REQ}

# Final Instructions


You should try to understand why a particular design performed well / poorly, so that you can make a more informed choice for the next set of designs. It is important to strike a good balance between exploration of the design space and tuning to find the best hyperparameter values. One way to tune is to develop some hypotheses about how the design might affect performance, and then conduct experiments that would test those hypotheses.

You are encouraged to consider configurations that we might not have thought of before, and it is likely that you will discover some patterns during your search process. You are STRONGLY encouraged to look through your experiment history and refer back to the designs that we have already tested, to make sure that the design you are proposing makes sense in that broader research context (i.e., are not too similar, and are informed by past results).

Feel free to think outside of the box - you are allowed to propose candidates that are high risk (or even expected to be quality-negative) if it helps you understand the problem better, furthers your long-term research agenda, and (most importantly) increases your chance to produce a final candidate. The goal is to produce a final candidate after roughly 500 attempts, not to find a locally-optimal solution right away. That said, please do be mindful of your compute usage - do not redo configurations that you have already tried (the results will almost certainly be the same), and please do your best to deliver a good candidate by the end of your 500 attempts. We will take the best candidate discovered in your entire tuning process as your final candidate - it does not matter WHEN you find a good candidate, as long as you eventually do so.

The knowledge base contains summarization of the trials you have done so far.
