## About the Project

This repo contains implementation for the [PACEvolve](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10657) paper.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing `PACEvolve` you need:

* **Python 3.9** or later
* We support OpenAI / Anthropic / Google Gemini APIs. You should have at least one API key available, more installation instructions can be found below.
* **Git**

The project relies on specific directory structures to locate tasks and configurations. Ensure your project root contains:
* `workflows/` (where this script resides)
* `tasks/` (containing task definitions and their respective environment installation requirements)

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/MinghaoYan/PACEvolve.git](https://github.com/MinghaoYan/PACEvolve.git)
cd auto-evo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Setup API Keys & Dependencies

You must configure the API keys and install the necessary packages for the models you intend to use. We currently support Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic.

**1. Set your API Keys**
Export the environment variables for the providers you plan to use:

```bash
# For Google Gemini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"

# For OpenAI (GPT-4)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"

# For Anthropic (Claude)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"

# Install all supported clients
pip install google-generativeai openai anthropic
```

Each task contains a config.yaml file in the config subdirectory, you can change the backbone llm by changing the llm section in the config file.


### 3. Running Your First Experiment
To run the evolutionary process, execute the script with a specific task_id. This assumes you have a task configuration file located at ../tasks/<task_id>/config/.

```bash
python run_experiment.py --task_id "my_task"
```
